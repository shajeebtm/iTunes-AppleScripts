# iTunes-AppleScripts
AppleScripts for getting some difficult tasks automated via iTunes

These scripts are mainly useful 
- if you manage ipod/iphone/ipad music library directly, means not synced with your laptop music library
- if you have thousands of songs with ID3V2 tag information set
- if you care about Album Name, Track Name, Artist Name, Composer Name and Album Artist Name
- if you organize songs into Folders, Playlists , esepcially smart playlists
- if you would like to copy playlists across multiple devices
- if you often add/remove songs in your device library and you want playlist & smart playlist to be updated


*Thanks to many online documents and discussions on managing iTunes by AppleScripts
